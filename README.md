# Survey-Form-FreeCodeCamp-1st-Project
This is my FIRST project in 2023. ( [https://ahmed-eldawoudy.github.io/Survay-Form-FreeCodeCamp-1st-Project-Aug2023-/](https://ahmed-eldawoudy.github.io/Survey-Form-FreeCodeCamp-1st-Project-Aug2023-/) )

This is the first Project of the [ *Responsive Web Design Certification* ] from FreeCodeCamp.

* I managed to pass the test required by FreeCodeCamp like below:

POSITIVES:

1- I got better and gain some confidence using HTML, specially HTML forms.

2- I got to apply some basic CSS ( not the best ) and make the form look someway good.

3- I used GOOGLE and been able to find answers to some of the problems I faced.

NEGATIVES:

1- The size is not responsive ( Don't Look good on small devices ) as I didn't got to the MediaQuerry section yet.

2- I don't like how the arrow on the [ select ] element has narrow space from the right and it's small ( I may Try to fix that later ).

3- same problem from (2) is on the age [ input ] element, the increase & decrease arrows are too small.

[ This is my first step, more will be done INSHAALLAH ]
